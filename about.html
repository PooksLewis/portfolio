    <p>Pookin is a pretty ridiculous family nickname that has managed to stick.  I grew up on a farm in Hereford on the English/Welsh border with my 
    3 siblings and various dogs and cats. For 7 years I have lived in Wales, which I love for all the mountains, beautiful coastline and 
    the valleys accent.  My love of design has been with me since I was a child, even then I would love to flick through my mumâ€™s 
    home interiors magazines. I studied graphic design for my degree and this reflects in my work which is
    heavily influenced by a love of colour and bold typography. I am inspired by the current trend for online shops such 
    as Etsy and Folksy where you can discover great pieces of contemporary craft and design. Besides design my 
    time is mainly filled with entertaining my fearless 1 year old, swimming, kayaking, eating 
    doughnuts and endlessly browsing Pinterest! Most recently I worked for a design and manufacturing company who make
    greetings cards, giftwrap and crackers for some of the UK's largest retailers. I am always happy to work on new projects, whatever the subject may be.  
    Please get in touch for any more information or to discuss a project.</p>
